# ROS-Python-Resistive-Grid-Implementation-for-AR-Drone-Parrot-2.0


Videos must be downloaded first and then dragged to a new internet tab to be seen.
- 
- Word map .dae is generated and given to the launch and world files, and then a python file with already the coordenates generated by the Resistive grid algorithm to go through the map are given. It is an open loop system.

  1. 1st part folder has launch and world files given from the repo, and then it's just testing the ardrone usage, with a small forward move and land with python.
  2. 2nd part folder has world file given by the .dae map generated and feed-forward the coordenates to the simulated drone.

Following repos are used:
